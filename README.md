This is a beginner attempt, made as a kickstart in the game development , in creating a Tic Tac Toe clone using the SDL.

Linux users should first install the required dependencies by executing the following command :

apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

The game supports two players via hotseat as a "vs cpu mode will be implemented in the future.

The gameboard is cleared when a winning or draw scenario is met.

Have fun.
